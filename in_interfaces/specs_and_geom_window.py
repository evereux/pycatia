                | viewer.
                | The specification viewer is located in the left part of the window and displays
                | the document's specification tree. The geometry viewer is located in the right
                | part of the window and displays the document's geometry, and can thus be a
                | Viewer2D or a Viewer3D, according to the document type. Even if generally the
                | two viewers are simultaneously displayed, one viewer or the other can be hidden
                | thanks to the CatSpecsAndGeomWindowLayout enumeration.
