                | This interface is used to access Processes, Products and
                | Resources.
                | Due to the inherent design restrictions, PPRDocument and another interface ProcessDocument need to
                | be used with care, since the ActiveDocument could be either ProcessDocument or PPRDocument. With that
                | in mind, a good practice of writing more robust VB script is to first tell the real type of document
                | (interface).
                | E.g. The following sentence
                | Dim MyDoc As PPRDocument
                | Set MyDoc = DELMIA.ActiveDocument.PPRDocument
                | could be replaced by the following:
                | Dim MyDoc As PPRDocument
                | Set MyProcDoc = DELMIA.ActiveDocument
                | if (TypeName(MyProcDoc)="ProcessDocument")
                | then MyDoc = MyProcDoc.PPRDocument
                | else MyDoc = DELMIA.ActiveDocument
                | end if
