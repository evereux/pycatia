                | An object can be moved only if it is independent from other objects. For
                | example, a pad can be moved, and is as such a movable object, while an edge
                | cannot be moved individually. It should be moved with all the objects making up
                | the pad to which it belongs as a whole. In this case, the underlying edge's
                | movable object is the pad.
