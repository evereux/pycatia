                |     create output in the corresponding native robot language.
                |     Role: Used to translate specified robot/device tasks to native robot
                |     language program(s). It is responsibility of specified xslt translator to
                |     provide the mechanism for saving its output to one or more
                |     files.

                |             string, no XSLT translation will be done, and only OLP XML file will be
                |             created. 
                |         sContext
                |             Value that defines a context in which an XSLT translator works.
                |             This tells the translator how to format the output. Internally, the XSLT
                |             translator should have a mechanism in place on how to format its output based
                |             on this value. This value is user defined and it may impact user developed
                |             downloaders as well as RRS2 custom created downloaders. Any value of this
                |             parameter, rather the supplied default value, will be assigned to the "Context"
                |             attribute of the "OLPData" XML element. Translators should check whether the
                |             "Context" attribute exists in the "OLPData" XML element, and if it does, they
                |             should redirect the XSLT output accordingly. If the attribute does not exist,
                |             which means that the translator has been invoked during execution of "Create
                |             Robot Program" interactive command, then the translators should use OLP section
                |             markers in order to display their output in V5.
                | 
                |             Here are the section marker rules that need to be strictly
                |             followed: It is important that the entire robot program output, designated to
                |             be saved in a particular file, is enclosed between DATA FILE START and DATA
                |             FILE END markers. Translator output without any DATA FILE START and DATA FILE
                |             END elements will be displayed in one tab page, generically named "Program.1".
                |             If translator output has DATA FILE START and DATA FILE END elements (multiple
                |             pairs),but without , each enclosed section of the output will go into a
                |             separate tab page named "Program.1", "Program.2",
                |             etc.
                | 
                |             Every downloader should use ERROR INFO START ERROR INFO END
                |             elements to store any error messages, in order to display them in the
                |             information text box of Download Editor.
                | 
                |             As with error messages, release and version information will be
                |             copied from the output's VERSION INFO START VERSION INFO END markers and will
                |             be displayed in the information text box of Download
                |             Editor.
                | 
                |             All of the marker elements need to start at the beginning of a new
                |             line and to end with a new line character. The examples are
