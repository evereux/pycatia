            | Represents all the Children of a CATIAStiDBItem.
            |
            | For each Child, we are able to retrieve its associated CATIAStiDBItem and the
            | Link Type (between itself and its father).
            | It should be represented as the following Correspondance Table { Child Number /
            | CATIAStiDBItem / Link Type}.
