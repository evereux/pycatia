                | 
                | Interface representing a device's Home Position.
                | 
                | Role: This interface is used to interact with a device's home positions. This
                | includes devices created in using V5 mechanisms or imported from DENEB
                | D5.
                | A home position is a list of values, each value being associated to each
                | Degrees Of Freedom(DOF) of the device, defining a state for the device (The
                | list size matches the number of commands that can be
                | simulated).
                | 
                | With home positions, it is possible to define Tool tips. A Tool tip is a
                | specific device part meant to be in contact with product(s). User may define
                | some device parts as tool tips so that, when they are in collision, the clash
                | is ignored. Tool tips are excluded from clash analysis in tools like DPM
                | Body-in-White's weldgun search.
                | 
                | The following code snippet can be used to obtain a home position from a
                | device.
