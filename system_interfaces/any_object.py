                | o Property Application() As Application (Read Only)
                |
                |     Returns the application. The application is the root object of the object
                |     structure and can be retrieved from any object in this object structure using
                |     the Application property. The root object, also called top-level object, is the
                |     object located at the top of the application's object structure. It is used by
                |     clients to retrieve and navigate across all the application's subordinate
                |     objects. If the client runs in-process, it retrieves the object at the top of
                |     the object structure. If the client runs out-process, it should call the
                |     GetApplication method to retrieve the object at the top of the object
                |     structure, which is the only object accessible from outside. The Application
                |     property is thus the way to jump from any object up to the root of the object
                |     structure, allowing then to navigate downwards. For in-process scripting, the
                |     application is always referred to as CATIA. Note that the Application property
                |     of the Application object returns the Application object
                |     itself.
                |
                |     Example:
                |         This example retrieves in CurrentApplication the application object,
                |         root of the object structure, from a given object of this structure: a document
                |         refered to using the MyDoc variable.

                |          Dim CurrentApplication As Application

                | o Property Name() As CATBSTR
                |
                |     Returns or sets the name of the object. The name is a character string
                |     automatically assigned to any object to handle it easier. Even if the Name
                |     property allows you to reassign an object name, this is not advised. Many
                |     objects, such as the application and the collections, have names that you must
                |     not change, and it's safer to use Name as a read only property. When an object
                |     is part of a collection, the object name can often be used in place of the
                |     object rank to retrieve or remove the object, providing the Item and Remove
                |     methods of the collection feature an argument with the Variant type. A name
                |     must start with a letter. It can include numbers, but it can't include spaces.
                |     If the object has no name set, the default name returned is the object type.
                |     For example, the Name property of a Viewer3D object with no name set returns
                |     Viewer3D.

                |     Example:

                |
                |     Returns the parent object. The parent object of a given object is the
                |     object just above in the object structure, usually the object that created this
                |     object and that aggregates it. In the case of an object part of a collection,
                |     the parent object can be the collection object itself or the object that
                |     aggregates the collection object. The Parent property is the way to step
                |     upwards in the object structure. Note that the Parent property of the
                |     Application object returns the Application object itself.
