                |
                |     Returns the application. The application is the root object in the object
                |     structure and can be retrieved from any object in the object structure using
                |     the Application property. The Application property is the way to jump from any
                |     object up to the root of the object data structure, allowing then to navigate
                |     downwards. For in-process scripting, the application is always referred to as
