                | Application
                | o Property Application(    ) As Application
                |
                | Returns the application. The application is the root object in the
                | object structure and can be retrieved from any object in the object
                | structure using the Application property. The Application property is
                | the way to jump from any object up to the root of the object data
                | structure, allowing then to navigate downwards. For in-process
                | scripting, the application is always referred to as CATIA. Note that
                | the Application property of the Application object returns the
                | Application object itself.  Example: This example retrieves in
                | CurrentApplication the application object, root of the object
                | structure, from a given object of this structure: a document refered
                | to using the MyDocCollecion variable.  Dim CurrentApplication As
                | Application Set CurrentApplication = MyDocCollecion.Application


                | Parameters:

                | Count
                | o Property Count(    ) As long
                |
                | Returns the number of objects in the collection. This is handy to scan
                | all the objects in a collection.  Example: This example retrieves in
                | ObjectNumber the number of objects currently gathered in MyCollection.
                | ObjectNumber = MyCollection.Count


                | Parameters:

        :return: int
        """
        return self.com_object.Count

                | Name
                | o Property Name(    ) As CATBSTR
                |
                | Returns or sets the name of the object. The name is a character string
                | you can assign to any object to handle it easier. In the case of an
                | object part of a collection, the name can often be used in place of
                | the object rank to retrieve or remove the object, providing the Item
                | and Remove methods of the collection feature an argument with the
                | Variant type. If the object has no name set, the name returned is the
                | one of its parent.  Example: This example sets to MyObject the name
                | Nice and Handy Object Name.  MyObject.Name("Nice and Handy Object
                | Name")


                | Parameters:

                | Parent
                | o Property Parent(    ) As CATBaseDispatch
                |
                | Returns the parent object. The parent object of a given object is the
                | object that created this object, usually the object just above in the
                | object tree structure and that aggregates it. In the case of an object
                | part of a collection, the parent object is not the collection object
                | itself, but the object that aggregates the collection object. The
                | Parent property is the way to step upwards in the object data
                | structure. Note that the Parent property of the Application object
                | returns the Application object itself.  Example: This example
                | retrieves in ParentObject the parent object of the GivenObject object.
                | Dim ParentObject As AnyObject Set ParentObject = GivenObject.Parent
