                | Role: All Automation interfaces must inherit from the CATBaseDispatch
                | interface. They usually do not inherit directly from CATBaseDispatch, but
                | rather from one of its subclasses: AnyObject for individual objects or
                | Collection for collection objects. Some methods may however have arguments of
                | type CATBaseDispatch when they accept both individual objects or collection
                | objects. The interface provides no functionalities per se.
