                | 2-D boundary.
                | Role: This Boundary object may be, for example, the lateral face of
                | cylinder.
                | You will create a Face object using the Shapes.GetBoundary ,
                | HybridShapes.GetBoundary , Sketches.GetBoundary or Selection.SelectElement2
                | method. Then, you pass it to the operator (such as
                | ShapeFactory.AddNewFaceFillet ).
                | The lifetime of a Face object is limited, see Boundary.
                | See also:
                | PlanarFace , CylindricalFace .
                |
                | Example:
                |     This example asks the end user to select two faces, and creates a face-face
                |     fillet on these faces:
                |
                |      Dim InputObjectType(0)
                |      Set Document = CATIA.ActiveDocument
                |      Set Selection = Document.Selection
                |      'We propose to the user that he select the first face
                |      InputObjectType(0)="Face"
                |      Status=Selection.SelectElement2(InputObjectType,"Select the first
                |      face",true)
                |      if (Status = "cancel") then Exit Sub
                |      Set FirstFace = Selection.Item(1).Value
                |      Selection.Clear
                |      'We propose to the user that he select the second face
                |      InputObjectType(0)="Face"
