                | 
                | Represents the CATIAInstanceFactory.
                | Role: This interface is used to create a new instance of a shape reference
                | (ShapeInstance ) or a hybrid shape reference ( HybridShapeInstance ) in case of
                | the instantiation of a User Feature.
                | It is also used to instantiate a Power Copy reference.
                | 
                | This interface contains two protocols of instantiation:
                | 
                |     The first protocol is dedicated to User Feature instantiation
                |     only.
                |     It is defined by a single method: AddInstance . It creates a shape or
                |     hybrid shape instance depending on the result of the User
                |     Feature.
                |     Use this method when you want to perform only one instantiation of the
                |     reference. Read the document containing the User Feature reference and
                |     instantiate it.
                |     As the document containing the reference is released from the session at
                |     the end of the instantiation, it is not recommmended to use this method if you
                |     want to perform several instantiations of the same reference in a
                |     loop.
                |     In that case, prefer the second protocol of instantiation.
                |     The second protocol is dedicated to both User Feature and Power Copy
                |     instantiations.
                |     It is defined by several methods that must be called in
                |     order.
                |         For User Feature instantiation, these methods are an alternative way of
                |         the AddInstance method.
                |         It is recommended to use the second protocol to perform several
                |         instantiations of the same reference in a loop.
                |         For Power Copy instantiation, it is the only way of instantiating a
                |         reference.
                |     The instantiation process is composed of three major
                |     steps:
                |         The first step BeginInstanceFactory consists in initializing the
                |         InstanceFactory with the reference and the document where it is
                |         stored.
                |         This step must be called once at the beginning whatever the number of
                |         instantiations are done.
                |         Optional step InstantiationMode allow the user to specify the mode of
                |         the instantiation, that is to say "After" or "Inside".
                |         If this method is not called, the instantiation mode will be chosen
                |         according to the BeginInstantiate method.
                |         The second step is the instantiation itself: it is composed of five
                |         methods that must be called in the order.
                |         This set of five methods can be called in a loop in order to make
                |         several instantiations.
                |             The method BeginInstantiate is used to initialize all data of the
                |             reference.
                |             The method PutInputData is used to set a value to any input of the
                |             reference.
                |             The method GetParameter is used to retrieve any parameter of the
                |             reference in order to modify its value.
                |             The method Instantiate is used to duplicate the reference. It
                |             returns the created instance when it does exist.
                |             The method EndInstantiate is used to indicate that the
                |             instantiation is done.
                |         The third step EndInstanceFactory consists in ending the instantiation
                |         and cleaning the InstanceFactory.
                |         When doing several instantiations in a loop, this step must be called
                |         just once at the end of all instantiations.
