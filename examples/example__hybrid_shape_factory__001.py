    Example - Hybrid Shape Factory - 001

    Description:
        Sequentially rename all points in geometric set (hybrid body) Points in the geometric set MasterGeometry.

    Requirements:
        - An open part document with the following geometric sets:
        
            Part
            |- MasterGeometry
                |- Points
