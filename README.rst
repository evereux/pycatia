pycatia
=======

alpha software
--------------

This is alpha software. All the test cases and examples work but there will be
many issues outside of the test framework. The CATIA com interface is huge and
I'm currently just attacking the items I think will be most useful. The
framework is in place for others to contribute so if you know CATIA and python
please do contribute. Bonus points for adding tests too.

I have limited access to CATIA licences / workbenches I so will not be able to
support those I can't test. If your company would like support for additional
workbenches adding to pycatia and can provide a license please contact me.


Why was it made?
----------------

pycatia was initially created to access the CATIA Automation Measurable object
and it's methods without the need of visual basic / CATScripts.

Some of the methods can be accessed directly using the pywin32 module but there
are a number that just simply won't work using python. There are several
questions on stack overflow and the pywin32 mailing list regarding this. But,
they fail to provide any working examples with the Measurable object in python.


pycatia accesses these methods by running VBA scripts using the 
`Dispatch('CATIA.Application').SystemService.Evaluate()` function and passing a
public function to it. Otherwise, pycatia uses the VB method directly but
exposes it within the same python class.


There is now further functionality available which can be seen by looking at
the examples provided and reading the API at pycatia.readthedocs.io_.

Asking Questions

Please read the following with regards to raising questions: https://github.com/evereux/pycatia/issues/28

Please do not email me directly requesting support unless this is business
related and you would like professional support.

Contributing
------------

If you would like to help contribute to pycatia you should start by looking
at the contents of the file v5automation-autogenerated.7z contained within this repository.

This archive was created by scraping through the contents of the V5Automation.chm help file
to re-construct all the classes and methods for python. It's largely complete but won't work
out the box without some tweaking. But these files should be the basis for any pull requests.
They will save you sometime and effort and ensure some consistency for the project.

If you have written a script using pycatia you would like to share you can:

* email me your script: evereux@gmail.com
* submit a pull request.
* raise an issue


Running The Tests
-----------------

On the first run, during the running of the tests, the test suite will create
the CATIA drawing, products and part it requires to run in the folder
tests/cat_files.

CATIA V5 should already be running and have NO documents already open.

To run the tests with coverage (-v is verbosity):

.. code-block:: python

    py.test -v --cov-report term-missing --cov=pycatia

To run a specific test:

.. code-block:: python

    py.test -v tests/test_product.py::test_move

To stop tests running after first failure.

    py.text -vx
