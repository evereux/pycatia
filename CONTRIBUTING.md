# CONTRIBUTING

# Git / Github

If you would like to contribute to pycatia there are a number of ways you can do this.

If your contribution is to the codebase you should learn the basics of git and github and how to create a fork of
pycatia and then a new branch for your specific pull request and creating the pull request itself.

With your pull request please also submit a small section of code that demonstrates how to use the class method you have
added / fixed.

# Which branch should I work on?

The master branch represents the latest released version of pycatia. Any pull requests against the pycatia application
itself shall not be done to this branch but the `developement` branch.

However, changes to the documentation or examples can be done against either.

## Adding new modules

I have now added all the modules I was able to extract from the documentation so there shouldn't be a need to add new
modules as of 0.6.0.

## Scripts / Examples

New scripts / examples are always welcome as they great for new users to discover how to use pycatia.

If you have written a script using pycatia you would like to share you can:

* email me your script: evereux@gmail.com
* submit a pull request - add the example to the existing examples.
* raise an issue

## Tests

There is a test framework in place that covers the basic set of pycatia features. However, there is a lot of work to do
here in expanding on those. Pull-requests expanding on these tests would be very much appreciated.
