                | 
                | Represents a DMU group.
                | The DMU group is an entity which gathers references to several products in
                | order to automate validation and verification of the Digital
                | Mock-Up.
                | 
                | A user can build a group using several methods: explicitely point out some
                | products or take all products by default. The designated products can be
                | intermediate or terminal node of the product structure. For instance, a user
                | who has to verify the integration of the engine in engine bay may define a
                | group with the engine assembly or with all the parts from the engine in order
                | to detect clashes. In the first case this user has to add the engine assembly
                | (as a product) in the group, and in the second case, to add all the parts to
                | the group. Obviously, when a modification happens to the engine assembly the
                | user has to change the group only in the second case. To manage the explicit
                | definition of the group, one may use the XxxxExplicit methods.
                | 
                | When the system takes the group into account to perform a given task, it may be
                | necessary to retrieve:
                | 
                |     The products designated by the user (For example, the section of these
                |     products)
                |     The terminal nodes (or leaves) of the product (For example, clash detection
                |     takes into account terminal nodes)
                |     The set of products in the product structure which are not selected (For
                |     example, hide all products which are not in the group)
                |     The set of terminal nodes which are not selected (For example, clash of
                |     some products against all others). 
                | 
                | To perform these treatments one may use YyyyExtract or ZzzzInvert
                | methods.
